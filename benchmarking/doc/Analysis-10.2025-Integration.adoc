**Key Findings:**

* **100 connections** achieves peak health throughput (77.1K ops/s) - optimal balance point
* **JWT performance** remains remarkably stable (20.1-21.6K ops/s) across all connection counts
* **50 connections** provides excellent baseline (66.9K ops/s health, 21.6K ops/s JWT) for CI/CD
* **150-250 connections** maintains consistent 70K ops/s health throughput with stable JWT performance
* **300 connections** shows slight degradation (67.9K ops/s health) but JWT remains stable at 20.4K ops/s
* **Cache effectiveness** confirmed with 100% hit rate across all runs (cache size 20)

=== Bottleneck Identification

**Root Cause: Docker Bridge Networking** 🎯

Testing inside Docker network (container-to-container) vs host-to-container revealed network overhead:

* **Container-to-container** (50 conns, health): 0.91ms avg latency, 74.3K ops/s
* **Host-to-container** (50 conns, health): 0.573ms P50 / 1.76ms P90, 66.9K ops/s (standard test setup)
* **Improvement**: +11% throughput when bypassing Docker bridge (host network stack)
* **Conclusion**: Application is performant. Docker bridge adds overhead. Production Kubernetes pod-to-pod networking performs better.

**Secondary Bottlenecks (Application-Level):**

1. **JWT processing overhead** (55,700 ops/s gap from health check with cache enabled)
2. **Token cache effectiveness** - Cache size of 20 achieved 100% hit rate (239,156/239,156 validations), providing 7.4% throughput improvement
3. **Average validation time** - 0.33ms per cached token (measured application metric)
4. **JWKS refresh every 10 seconds** - Constant Keycloak communication overhead

=== JWT Validation Performance Breakdown

**Measured validation time:** 0.21ms average (application metric, from Prometheus)
- Total validations: 280,303 (latest benchmark run)
- Cache hit rate: 100%
- **Validation accounts for 12% of total latency** (0.21ms out of 1.72ms P50)

**Latency breakdown (50 connections baseline):**
```
JWT P50 Total:                           1.72ms (100%)
├─ Base HTTP overhead (health baseline): 0.345ms (20%)
├─ JWT validation (library):             0.210ms (12%)
└─ Framework overhead (unexplained):     1.165ms (68%)
```

**The 68% unexplained latency likely comes from:**
- Response serialization (5-10x larger payload than health endpoint)
- CDI request-scoped producer overhead
- Token claims extraction and response building
- HTTP payload processing
- Library integration overhead vs micro-benchmarks

=== Performance Ceiling

* **Health check capacity**: 77.1K ops/s at 100 connections (peak performance)
* **JWT validation capacity**: 21.6K ops/s at 50-100 connections (cache enabled, 100% hit rate)
* **Performance gap**: 55.5K ops/s between health and JWT endpoints at peak
* **Stability range**: JWT maintains 20.1-21.6K ops/s across 50-300 connections (excellent stability)

**Throughput gap explanation:**

The 3.5x throughput difference (77K health vs 22K JWT) is primarily due to:
- **5x latency difference** (1.72ms JWT vs 0.345ms health)
- **1.86x more threads** (67 JWT vs 36 health) with worse per-thread efficiency
- **13% more CPU usage** (78% JWT vs 69% health)

The gap is **NOT caused by cryptographic validation** (only 0.21ms, 12% of latency), but by REST framework overhead (response building, serialization, HTTP processing).

== Conclusion

Comprehensive WRK stress testing across 50-300 connections reveals:

* **Peak performance**: 77.1K ops/s health (100 conns), 21.6K ops/s JWT (50-100 conns)
* **Excellent stability**: JWT maintains 20.1-21.6K ops/s across all connection counts (50-300)
* **Optimal configuration**: 100 connections provides best balance (77.1K health, 21.6K JWT)
* **Latency characteristics**: Health 0.573-3.77ms P50, JWT 2.05-12.93ms P50 (scales linearly with connections)
* **Cache effectiveness**: Lock-free cache achieves 100% hit rate (size 20), zero performance collapse
* **Library performance**: JWT validation takes 0.21ms (12% of latency) - library is fast, framework overhead dominates
* **Performance gap**: 55.5K ops/s difference due to framework overhead (68% unexplained latency), not cryptographic validation
