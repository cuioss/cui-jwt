/**
 * HTTP content converters for secure JSON processing.
 * <p>
 * This package contains converters that handle HTTP response content
 * transformation with security-focused JSON parsing capabilities.
 * <p>
 * Key components:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link de.cuioss.tools.net.http.converter.JsonContentConverter} - Secure JSON content converter using DSL-JSON</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The converters use DSL-JSON with configurable security limits to prevent
 * JSON-based attacks such as excessive memory consumption and deeply nested
 * structure attacks, while providing Jakarta JSON API compatibility through
 * bridge adapters.
