/**
 * High-metrics monitoring components for JWT validation pipeline metrics analysis.
 * <p>
 * This package provides thread-safe, low-overhead metrics monitoring capabilities
 * for JWT validation operations. The components are designed to have minimal runtime
 * impact while providing detailed insights into validation metrics.
 * <p>
 * Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Lock-free operations:</strong> All measurements use atomic operations only</li>
 *   <li><strong>Microsecond precision:</strong> High-resolution timing for accurate analysis</li>
 *   <li><strong>Rolling window sampling:</strong> Configurable sample size for recent measurements</li>
 *   <li><strong>Pipeline-aware:</strong> Separate measurements for each validation step</li>
 *   <li><strong>Thread-safe:</strong> Optimized for high-concurrency environments</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The monitoring system follows the same design principles as the security monitoring
 * components, providing a framework-agnostic foundation that can be integrated with
 * external monitoring systems like Micrometer/Prometheus in higher-level modules.
