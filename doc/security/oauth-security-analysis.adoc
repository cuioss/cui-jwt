== Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of OAuth-related security vulnerabilities as documented in the article "Common OAuth Vulnerabilities" from Doyensec (https://blog.doyensec.com/2025/01/30/oauth-common-vulnerabilities.html). Each vulnerability is analyzed in the context of JWT token handling, the current mitigation approach in our library is documented, and test coverage is assessed.

For detailed implementation information on how these mitigations are implemented, see the link:security-specifications.adoc#oauth-security-considerations[OAuth Security Considerations] section in the Security Specifications document.

For guidance on secure OAuth implementation practices for application developers, see the link:jwt-security-best-practices.adoc[JWT Security Best Practices Guide].

== Vulnerability Analysis

=== Client Confusion Attack

==== Description
The client confusion attack occurs when a token issued for one client is used with a different client. This attack is possible when applications implementing OAuth don't verify that the token was generated for their specific client ID. An attacker could create a malicious website that implements OAuth login, collect legitimate access tokens from users, and then use these tokens to impersonate users on vulnerable applications that don't validate the token's intended audience.

==== Impact

* Account takeover
* Authentication bypass
* Session hijacking

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library has implemented protections against client confusion attacks. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#client-confusion-attack[Client Confusion Attack] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**

* link:../../oauth-sheriff-core/src/main/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/oauth/core/pipeline/validator/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator.java:233-249] - Audience claim validation prevents token misuse across clients
* link:../../oauth-sheriff-core/src/main/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/oauth/core/pipeline/validator/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator.java:387-413] - Authorized Party (azp) validation verifies token was issued for the specific client
* link:../../oauth-sheriff-core/src/main/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/oauth/core/IssuerConfig.java[IssuerConfig.java] - Configuration enforces expectedClientId and expectedAudience validation
* Mandatory azp validation when expectedClientId is configured prevents cross-client token usage

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../oauth-sheriff-core/src/test/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/oauth/core/ClientConfusionAttackTest.java[ClientConfusionAttackTest] - Tests specifically for client confusion attacks:
** `verify_azp_validation()` - Verifies that tokens with valid `azp` claims are accepted
** `verify_azp_validation_failure()` - Verifies that tokens with invalid `azp` claims are rejected
** `verify_different_client_token_rejected()` - Verifies that tokens from different clients are rejected
** `verify_audience_validation_without_azp()` - Verifies audience validation
** `verify_azp_validation_without_audience()` - Verifies `azp` validation without audience
** `verify_missing_azp_rejected()` - Verifies rejection of tokens with missing `azp` claims

=== Scope Upgrade Attack

==== Description
The scope upgrade attack occurs when an attacker attempts to add additional scopes during the token exchange process. If the authorization server accepts and implicitly trusts a `scope` parameter sent in the Access Token Request, a malicious application could try to upgrade the scope of Authorization Codes retrieved from user callbacks by sending a higher privileged scope in the Access Token Request.

==== Impact

* Privilege escalation
* Unauthorized access to protected resources

==== Current Implementation Status: PARTIALLY MITIGATED
The library provides tools for scope validation but requires proper implementation at the application level. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#scope-upgrade-attack[Scope Upgrade Attack] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**

* link:../../oauth-sheriff-core/src/main/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/oauth/core/domain/token/AccessTokenContent.java[AccessTokenContent.java] - Provides access to scope claims from validated tokens
* Scope validation must be implemented at the application level using the parsed token content
* The library validates token integrity but does not enforce scope restrictions (authorization server responsibility)
* Applications should validate scopes against expected permissions before granting resource access

==== Test Coverage
No specific tests for scope upgrade attack prevention.

=== CSRF Attacks

==== Description
OAuth CSRF is an attack against OAuth flows, where the browser consuming the authorization code is different than the one that has initiated the flow. It can be used by an attacker to coerce the victim to consume their Authorization Code, causing the victim to connect with attacker's authorization context.

==== Impact

* Account hijacking
* Session fixation
* Unauthorized authentication

==== Current Implementation Status: OUT OF SCOPE
CSRF protection is primarily a concern at the application level, not in the token validation library. For best practices on preventing CSRF attacks, see link:jwt-security-best-practices.adoc#token-lifecycle-management[Token Lifecycle Management] in the JWT Security Best Practices Guide.

**Implementation Details:**

* CSRF attacks occur during OAuth authorization flows, before token issuance
* Token validation libraries operate after tokens are issued and do not handle OAuth flows
* Applications must implement state parameter validation and proper CSRF tokens during OAuth flows
* The library validates token integrity once received but cannot prevent CSRF during authorization

==== Test Coverage
No specific tests for CSRF protection as it's out of scope for the token validation library.

=== Redirect Attacks

==== Description
If the Authorization Server does not properly validate the `redirect_uri` parameter, a malicious actor can manipulate a victim to complete a flow that will disclose their Authorization Code to an untrusted party. Common validation mistakes include validating only the domain (not the full path), allowing subdomains, subpaths, wildcards, or using improper regular expressions.

==== Impact

* Authorization code theft
* Account takeover
* Token leakage

==== Current Implementation Status: OUT OF SCOPE
Redirect URI validation is the responsibility of the authorization server, not the token validation library. For best practices on secure OAuth implementation, see link:jwt-security-best-practices.adoc#secure-token-handling-on-the-client[Secure Token Handling on the Client] in the JWT Security Best Practices Guide.

==== Test Coverage
No specific tests for redirect attacks as they're out of scope for the token validation library.

=== Mutable Claims Attack

==== Description
The mutable claims attack exploits the fact that some OAuth providers allow users to change certain claims (like email) without verification. If a client application uses these mutable claims for user identification instead of the immutable `sub` claim, an attacker could take over user accounts by creating an account with the victim's email.

==== Impact

* Account takeover
* Identity spoofing

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library enforces validation of the `sub` claim to mitigate mutable claims attacks. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#mutable-claims-attack[Mutable Claims Attack] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**

* link:../../oauth-sheriff-core/src/main/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/oauth/core/pipeline/validator/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator.java] - Validates presence and format of subject (sub) claim
* All token types (AccessTokenContent, IdTokenContent, RefreshTokenContent) expose the immutable `sub` claim
* Applications are guided to use `getSubject()` method for user identification rather than mutable claims like email
* Library ensures `sub` claim is always present and validated in all token types

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../oauth-sheriff-core/src/test/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/oauth/core/pipeline/validator/TokenClaimValidatorTest.java[TokenClaimValidatorTest] - Tests specifically for mutable claims validation:
** `shouldValidateTokenWithValidSubjectClaim()` - Verifies that tokens with valid subject claims are accepted
** `shouldFailValidationForTokenWithMissingSubjectClaim()` - Verifies that tokens with missing subject claims are rejected
** `shouldValidateTokenWithEmptySubjectClaim()` - Documents current behavior with empty subject claims
** `shouldValidateTokenWithMutableClaims()` - Verifies that tokens with mutable claims are accepted when subject is present

=== Redirect Scheme Hijacking

==== Description
When OAuth is used in mobile applications, developers often use custom URL schemes to receive authorization codes. However, multiple applications can register the same URL scheme on a device, potentially allowing a malicious app to intercept authorization codes meant for the legitimate app.

==== Impact

* Authorization code theft
* Account takeover

==== Current Implementation Status: OUT OF SCOPE
Mobile app redirect scheme handling is outside the scope of the token validation library. For best practices on securing mobile OAuth flows, see link:jwt-security-best-practices.adoc#secure-token-handling-on-the-client[Secure Token Handling on the Client] in the JWT Security Best Practices Guide.

**Implementation Details:**

* Redirect scheme hijacking occurs during OAuth authorization flows, before token issuance
* Token validation libraries operate after tokens are issued and do not handle mobile redirect schemes
* Mobile applications must implement proper redirect URI validation and use platform-specific secure mechanisms
* The library validates token integrity once received but cannot prevent redirect interception during authorization

==== Test Coverage
No specific tests for redirect scheme hijacking as it's out of scope for the token validation library.

== Security Testing Recommendations


=== Mutable Claims Testing

==== Recommended Test Cases

[cols="2,3,1", options="header"]
|===
|Test Case |Description |Expected Outcome
|verify_sub_validation |Test token validation with valid subject claim |Success
|verify_missing_sub |Test token validation with missing subject claim |Failure
|verify_empty_sub |Test token validation with empty subject claim |Failure
|===

==== Implementation Plan

1. Enhance `TokenClaimValidatorTest` to include specific tests for subject claim validation
2. Verify that tokens without valid subject claims are rejected

== Summary and Recommendations

The library currently implements good mitigations for client confusion attacks but could benefit from additional test coverage for scope validation and mutable claims handling. The following recommendations are made to further improve security:

1. Add specific tests for scope validation functionality
2. Enhance documentation about the importance of using the immutable `sub` claim for user identification
3. Consider adding explicit warnings when applications use mutable claims for user identification
4. Maintain clear documentation about which OAuth vulnerabilities are addressed by the library and which are the responsibility of the application developer
