== Overview
_See Requirement xref:../Requirements.adoc#OAUTH-SHERIFF-8[OAUTH-SHERIFF-8: Security Requirements] and Specification xref:../Specification.adoc[Specification] and xref:security-specifications.adoc[Security Specification]_

This document outlines the threat model for the JWT Token Validation library. The threat model follows OWASP recommendations and identifies potential security threats, current mitigations, and additional recommendations.

== System Context

The JWT Token Validation library operates within the following context:

* Processes JWT tokens from OAuth2/OpenID Connect providers
* Validates token signatures using JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets)
* Extracts and processes token claims
* Handles multiple token types (Access, ID, Refresh)
* Supports multiple issuers
* Implements key management and rotation

=== Detailed Analysis

For a detailed analysis of each threat, mitigation, and recommendation, please refer to the xref:threat-coverage-analysis.adoc[Threat Coverage Analysis] document.

=== Conclusion

The JWT Token Validation library provides robust security measures for JWT token validation, with comprehensive coverage for most of the threats identified in the threat model. All threats and current mitigations are covered in specifications, and the vast majority are also covered in tests. The recommendations have lower coverage, which is expected as they represent potential future enhancements rather than current requirements.

The areas for improvement identified in the xref:threat-coverage-analysis.adoc[Threat Coverage Analysis] document could be addressed in future versions to further enhance the security of the library.
