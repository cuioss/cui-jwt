==== Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

This document provides detailed specifications for the token decryption support in the JWT Token Validation library. Token decryption support is marked as optional for a future version in the requirements.

== JWE Token Structure

The current implementation supports JWS (JSON Web Signature) tokens but lacks support for JWE (JSON Web Encryption) tokens. JWE tokens have a different structure than JWS tokens, consisting of five parts instead of three:

1. JOSE Header (Base64URL-encoded)
2. JWE Encrypted Key (Base64URL-encoded)
3. JWE Initialization Vector (Base64URL-encoded)
4. JWE Ciphertext (Base64URL-encoded)
5. JWE Authentication Tag (Base64URL-encoded)

== Implementation Requirements

=== Parser Modifications

==== NonValidatingJwtParser Extensions

The `NonValidatingJwtParser` class needs to be extended to recognize and handle JWE tokens:

* Add detection logic to identify JWE vs JWS tokens (based on number of parts and header content)
* Implement JWE token parsing without decryption for inspection purposes
* Update size validation to account for JWE token structure

==== JweParser Interface

A new `JweParser` interface and implementation should be created for decrypting JWE tokens:

* Support required JWE content encryption algorithms (A128CBC-HS256, A256CBC-HS512, A128GCM, A256GCM, etc.)
* Support required key management algorithms:
  ** RSA-OAEP (RSAES OAEP using default parameters - SHA-1)
  ** RSA-OAEP-256 (RSAES OAEP using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256)
  ** ECDH-ES (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static)
  ** Other algorithms as defined in RFC 7518

* Implement content encryption key (CEK) decryption
* Implement payload decryption and authentication

NOTE: It's important to distinguish between:

* **Key Management Algorithms** (e.g., RSA-OAEP): Used to encrypt/decrypt the Content Encryption Key (CEK)
* **Content Encryption Algorithms** (e.g., A256GCM): Used to encrypt/decrypt the actual JWT payload
* **Signature Algorithms** (e.g., RS256): Used for JWS tokens, not JWE tokens

=== Data Model Extensions

==== DecodedJwt Extensions

The `DecodedJwt` class needs to be extended to support JWE structure:

* Add fields for JWE-specific parts (encrypted key, initialization vector, ciphertext, authentication tag)
* Update constructors and methods to handle JWE tokens
* Add methods to access JWE-specific information

==== DecryptedJwt Class

A new `DecryptedJwt` class should be created to represent a decrypted JWE token:

* Include methods to access the decrypted payload
* Maintain the original encrypted parts for reference

=== Key Management Extensions

==== JwksLoader Extensions

The `JwksLoader` interface needs to be extended to support encryption keys:

* Add support for loading encryption keys from JWKS endpoints
* Implement key identification for encryption keys
* Add methods to retrieve appropriate keys for decryption

==== Key Resolution for Decryption

Implement key resolution for decryption:

* Support "kid" header parameter for key identification
* Support "alg" header parameter for algorithm selection
* Support "enc" header parameter for content encryption algorithm

==== RSA-OAEP Algorithm Support

Based on analysis of Keycloak integration, RSA-OAEP is a standard encryption algorithm that needs to be supported:

* **RSA-OAEP** is used for key encryption in JWE (JSON Web Encryption), not for signing
* It is the default key encryption algorithm in Keycloak when using RSA public keys
* RSA-OAEP (using SHA-1) and RSA-OAEP-256 (using SHA-256) are both defined in RFC 7518
* These are distinct from signature algorithms (RS256, RS384, RS512) which are used for JWS

Current limitations:

* The `JwkAlgorithmPreferences` class only supports signature algorithms
* When encountering RSA-OAEP keys in JWKS, the system logs a warning: "Invalid or unsupported algorithm: RSA-OAEP"
* This is expected behavior since JWE decryption is not yet implemented

Future implementation should:

* Separate encryption algorithm preferences from signature algorithm preferences
* Support both RSA-OAEP and RSA-OAEP-256 for key encryption
* Follow RFC 7518 specifications for JWE key management algorithms

=== Security Considerations

==== Secure Handling of Decryption Keys

Implement secure handling of decryption keys:

* Ensure private keys are properly protected
* Implement key rotation support for decryption keys

==== JWE-specific Security Requirements

Add validation for JWE-specific security requirements:

* Validate encryption algorithms against allowed list
* Implement proper authentication tag validation
* Add protection against padding oracle attacks

=== Testing Requirements

==== JWE Functionality Tests

Create comprehensive tests for JWE functionality:

* Test parsing of JWE tokens
* Test decryption of JWE tokens with various algorithms
* Test handling of malformed JWE tokens
* Test error cases and edge conditions

==== JWE Security Tests

Add security tests specific to JWE:

* Test against known vulnerabilities in JWE implementations
* Test algorithm downgrade protection
* Test key confusion attack prevention
